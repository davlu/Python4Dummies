#Hello today we are going to be coding in Python programming language, if you do not have Python latest version installed #please go to https://www.python.org/ and install Python 3.6.2
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Now the basics to code in Python is to import modules, modules are well... modules or if you prefer something simpler: add-#ons, these add-ons (modules) are just like Chrome, Steam or game mods (add-ons, modules), when imported correctly (just #like moving a file of the mod to the game folder) you can use and manipulate things in a way that the vanilla software can't, #to import a module it is quite simple, just use import followed by the space bar and the name of the module
#Today we are going to use these simple modules which are the sys, os, time and math for simple things like equations

import sys
import os
import time
import math
 
#or you can use a list of import just by doing this: import math, time, os, sys

#Now let's use the "print" function, the print function is pretty straight forward right? it prints the writing on the screen!

print "This is a print message"

#Now let's try using a string to print out something, a string is a string of characters to characterize your string you just write any name in our case x = "your string here"

x = "This is a string"

#To invoke strings you just type them without "" quotation marks

print x

#We can also print numbers by using integers, to do that you replace the quotation mark and text for a number like below

y = 1

#To invoke the integer you can do the same with the string 

print y

#You can combine strings and integers simply by adding both together

print x + y

#Now let's learn some basic math using the math modules and print module, we will use the letter z and it is as simple as this:

z = 24+12

#To invoke you do the same as the previous ones

print z

#Or you can just do it manually

print 24+12
