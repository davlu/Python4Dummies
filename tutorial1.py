#Hello today we are going to be coding in Python programming language, if you do not have Python latest version installed please go to https://www.python.org/ and install Python 3.6.2
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Now let's use the "print" function, the print function is pretty straight forward right? it prints the writing on the screen!

print ("This is a print message")

#Now let's try using a string to print out something, a string is a string of characters to characterize your string you just write any name in our case x = "your string here"

x = "This is a string"

#To invoke strings you just type x or the name you gave to the string

print x

#We can also print numbers by using integers, to do that you replace the quotation mark and text for a number like below

y = 1

#To invoke the integer you can do the same you did with the string 

print y

#You can combine strings and integers simply by adding both together

print x + y

#Now let's learn some basic math using the addition function and print function, we will use the letter z and it is as simple as this:

z = 24+12

#To invoke you do the same as the previous ones

print z

#Or you can just do it manually

print (24+12)
